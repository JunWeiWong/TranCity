- Created the Super class TransitNode so that BusStop and SubwayStation inherit from the super class.
- Created the Super class TransitPath so that BusRoute and SubwayLine inherit from the super class.
- Created the Super class TransitSystem so that BusSystem and SubwaySystem inherit from the super class.
(The above three  super classes are used for expandable design.)
